title: Select XML parser at runtime
desc: |-
  XML parsing is done by three different classes: SoapResponse, SoapResponseHpricot, and SoapResponseExpat.  The Binding class, in a holdover from the old days, is hard-coded to use SoapResponse.
  
  At the very least, we should scan the installed libraries / gems and choose the fastest one available.  We might also allow Binding's initializer to pass in a specific parser.

  - Used the simple fix of seeing which constants are defined and assigning SoapResponse based on that.
